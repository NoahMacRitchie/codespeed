## About this project

Codespeed is a desktop application used to elevate a developers ability to write code quickly. With CodeSpeed users can practice, analyze and improve their code typing skills.

#### Features
- Smart code typing page where the user can time how fast they code the code prompt. ![<img src="image.png" width="100"/>](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/460232109085425684/1022290673254289408/typingscreen.gif )
- Statistics page where users can analyze their typing mistakes and learn where they need to improve.

- Uses our own api created with NodeJs and Firebase's realtime database to fetch code prompts

#### Over the Horizon
Our team has so many fun ideas for the future of this project. Just to name a few...
- Settings page where users can choose between different settings such as...
  - Tabs vs Spaces
  - Different coding languages
  - Color themes
- Create a ton of graphs and more ways to analyze the users typing data. 
- Use some machine learning algorithms to pick up on the users mistakes and give them code prompts that directly challenges their biggest weaknesses.
- Ability to challenge another developer in a live coding race using sockets

### Why did we create this?

When learning to code most beginners tend to use the keyboard shown below.

As a developer it can be very embarrassing to type slowly, especially when your boss is watching you. It can be very easy to focus solely on learning how code works and neglect your ability to type it quickly. When most developers land a job, their fingers can not keep up with their brain.

Most people have tried programs that aim to help you type quicker.  Those programs don not help developers type code quicker. Typing a function or a class is much different than typing a paragraph. Paragraphs do not have frequent parenthesies, semicolons, angled braces, astricks, back ticks, etc.
